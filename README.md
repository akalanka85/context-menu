# Context Menu

The ContextMenu is a reusable TypeScript class that creates a custom context menu for a specified HTML element. It allows the user to define menu items and their associated actions, and it handles various interactions like right-clicking, clicking outside the menu, and keyboard events.

This README file describes the usage, functionality, and integration of the ContextMenu class in the project.

## Features
- Customizable Context Menu: Dynamically render a context menu with custom items and actions.
- Keyboard Support: The menu can be dismissed with the Escape key.
- Responsive Positioning: The menu adjusts its position based on the viewport, preventing it from going off-screen.
- Right-click Prevention: The default context menu is disabled in non-target areas.
